      Project Website
    </a>

This is a website project that i developed when taking a web project course on Udemy.<br><br>
The website layout is primarily done using CSS Flexbox.<br><br>
I have also added a bit of Javascript code to enable the display of the navigation menu<br><br>
I used CSS transform properties to make each sections of the website rotate on their "y-axis"<br><br>
I have also used Javascript and CSS to make the videos play/pause when mouseover or mouseout.<br><br>
The website is responsive to all screen sizes using CSS "media queries".
